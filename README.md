**Task 3: Book Management REST API**

This is a simple and clean RESTful API built using **Node.js** and **Express.js** to perform basic CRUD operations on a list of books (stored in memory, no database).

This project is part of my **Web Development Internship (Task 3)**.

**Features**

- View all books (`GET /books`)
- Add a new book (`POST /books`)
- Update an existing book (`PUT /books/:id`)
- Delete a book (`DELETE /books/:id`)
- Automatically **reorders book IDs** after deletion to maintain serial order

**Technologies Used**

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Postman (for API testing)
